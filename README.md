# Luna

**Note: this is very WIP. The current status as of 25/03/2024 is that it configures without errors, however you have to skip some false errors in the configure phase. I will do a build guide in the wiki soon with how to set up the dependencies for compiling.**

This is a web browser for the Windows on ARMv7 platform, which runs on devices such as the Surface RT. I won't promise a release date for this yet but I promise that I will do my best at porting.

Oh and if you are interested in building this, do NOT follow the Pale Moon build guide as it is meant for Win32/Win64 targets. Please wait for me to do a build guide for Luna.

## Getting the platform sub-module
`git submodule init && git submodule update`
